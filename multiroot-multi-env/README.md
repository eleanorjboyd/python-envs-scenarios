# Multiroot Python Workspace

This Visual Studio Code workspace contains three Python project roots:

- `workspace1` with `random_script1.py`
- `workspace2` with `random_script2.py`
- `workspace3` with `random_script3.py`

Each script prints a random number from a different range. You can run any script by opening its folder and running:

```bash
python random_scriptX.py
```

Replace `X` with 1, 2, or 3 depending on the workspace.
